Presentation is on 7/1/16



? maybe have free play at menu / demo 0? easy to get to.
 * space = cymbal
 * bottom letters = drums
 * letters = notes
 * numbers to change wave forms & toggle effects?

* invite nathan and sound guys too

? lament of tim curry may make good intro music? play it looping
 * or maybe some looping mellow house music clip kinda thing?
 * maybe tim curry without the intro and outro

! code that can be used for offline or real time both?
 * maybe modes should be:
  * real time play
  * real time play + record as wav
  * non real time record as wav
 * maybe more work than is needed
 * maybe just a quick example of how to write a wave file?
  * or point to blog that explains how to do it


! make the music that brings it all together?
 * maybe make the music as we go? i dunno...

! make the demo 0_BGMusic
 * make it from things you showcase in the demos, so it comes together by the end.
 * demo the bg music again at the end to show how it all came together.

! make sure video recording and room will pick up audio ok.
 * talk to paul haban.

? should we do a stereo demo? not sure if will work in room. should try

? make a generic synth for people to play? make it be the first demo, even before the bg music? could invite people to play if extra time

Presentation Outline:

--1--
 * title / background music? explaining that bg music was made with the things being talked about.
 * I wanted to make this presentation since paul started doing code & tells, finally got around to it.
 * DEMO = 0_BGMusic

--2--
 * What is audio data?
  * usually from -1.0 to 1.0. (*HDR audio, non floating point, etc)
  * changes in values are what makes sounds, a constant value is silence, no matter what the value is.
  * sound = pressure waves in the air, so speaker needs to move to make changes in pressure.
  * sound value dictates what position the speaker should be at.
  * better speakers are able get to the right places the samples specify more quickly and more accurately.  worse speakers end up with wrong frequencies.
  * resolution:
   * x axis = sample rate. samples per second.
   * y axis = bit depth. bits per sample.
   * may also have multiple channels (like, stereo) data interleaved.
   * an uncompressed wav file is literally just a header, and then audio samples
  * decibels vs amplitude and perception of loudness?

--2.5--
 * what is a note? octave?
 * explain how to calculate the frequency of notes, and show some notes & frequencies in a table
 * note that other music styles (asian, middle eastern) have different systems.  it "sounds" right to us, but only because it's what we were taught.

--3--
 * sine wave = gently changing up and down.  all audio data is made of sine waves.
 * more sine waves per second = higher frequency, fewer sine waves per second = lower frequency.
  * show sine tones at diff frequencies
  * demo: press buttons to change frequencies from low to high
  * DEMO = Sine
 * like audio data, it's the difference between notes that is important not the notes themselves.
 * midi devices are not that hard to get working, but using QWERTY
 ! note that keyboards are bad at pressing multiple keys at once.
  * keyboardsareevil.com

--4--
 * Note sliding and popping: free spinning oscilators vs not.  audio needs to be smooth!
  * show playing notes one after the other, having popping
  * Note: can also come from changing volume quickly, so need to apply smooth volume over time.
  * demo: let people hear it
  * show the fix: free spinning oscilator
  * show note sliding
  * demo: let people hear it with popping and without.
  * DEMO = Popping

--5--
 * clipping: when things get too high or low, it clips then, making distortion.
  * show clipped sine tones at different volumes
  * sometimes desired though.  Electric guitar distortion takes it's roots from this for instance.
  * demo: play some clipped notes.  adjust volume to make more or less clipping?
  * DEMO = Clipping
  ! Note: sounds "8 bit" cause the taller a sine wave becomes, the more "square wave" it becomes. old systems did square waves cause they are fast to compute!

--6--
 * Mixing: add values together to mix them together and make them both be able to be heard!
  * don't thinks clip? in practice it takes quite a bit to make that happen! manual process to correct levels though. although you can do "automatic volume adjustments" both in real time and "offline" with limiters and compressors
  * don't play at full volume though?
  * demo: polyphonic tones with a decently long envelope. maybe some w/ extra long envelope and cause clipping? button to silence it :P
  * Note: polyphonic
  * Note: turn down volume a bit to keep from clipping. turn volume up to max, show how you can cause clipping.
  * Note: can also kill all but last 3 or 4 notes played.
  * NOTE: this clipping is done 100% in my software.  I'm not maxing out any speakers or anything. no damage
  * DEMO = Mixing

--7--
 * Envelopes
  * show a few examples
  * demo: demo a few examples
  * DEMO = Envelopes

--8--
 * Common wave forms
  * show square, saw, triangle and sine
  * demo: each wave form.  point out how similar sine and triangle are.  triangle was used because sine was too costly to compute.
 * DEMO = WaveForms

--9--
 * Aliasing
  * nyquist frequency
  * bandlimited wave forms (w/ equations?)
  * mention additive synthesis being a way of building up a sound from nothing by adding things together.
  * demo: bandlimited vs not wave forms.
 * DEMO = BLWaveForms

--9.5--
 * Additive Synth
 * can analyze a sound to see what frequencies are present, at which volumes, over time.
 * pick the N most prominent frequencies, and play them, makign envelopes that match the real sound.
 * instead of analyzing you can also just throw them together.
 * DEMO = Additive

--10--
 * Tremolo & Vibrato
  * Tremolo: modify amplitude on a low frequency sine wave
  * Vibrato: modify frequency on a low frequency sine wave
  * (modular synth = plug anything into anything else, so like, you could plug a saw wave into vibrato etc)
  * demo: some notes with vibrato, some notes with tremolo
 * DEMO = TremVib
 * note: The effects have 2 params: frequency and depth. tremolo depth = how long and high it makes it. vibrato depth = how much higher or lower the frequency gets.
 * note: i have them on a sine wave (LFO - low frequency oscilator), but you could put the effects on other wave forms, even have some other sound controlling the effect!

--11--
 * Frequency Modulation Synthesis (FM Synth)
  * bringing tremolo up to audble frequencies = AM synth, aka amplitude modulation synth.
   * Never been able to make it sound interesting, so not so useful IMO.
  * bring vibrato up to audible frequencies = FM sytnh.
  * show: book about it, talk about complexities
  * demo: play some FM synth notes
  * great read: http://the-all.org/tx81z/fm_overview.html (get some notes there, like what increasing speed vs depth does)
 * DEMO = FMSynth

--12--
 * Delay (echo)
  * talk about having a buffer of the right number of samples with some feedback volume.  Circular buffer.
  * demo: play some notes that are aligned to timing, and some that aren't.
 * mention wet vs dry. should demo let you adjust wet vs dry?
 * DEMO = Delay

--13--
 * Reverb
  * explain multitap.  mention convolution reverb.  Reference blog post on how to do it.
  * demo: play some sweet sweet notes with multitap reverb
  * could play multitap next to convolution reverb to show difference in quality
 ! note: multitap is aproximation of convolution. more taps = closer to convolution
 * Demo = Reverb

--14--
 * Flange
  * explain origins.  explain how to simulate.  talk about sub sample interpolation.  linear, cubic hermite, sync, etc.
  * demo: wave forms with flange.
 ! note: the sauce = "reverb + flange"
 * Demo = Flange

--15--
 * Basic Drum
  * explain how to do it.
  * demo: step by step to improve it's sound.
  * mention you could use sound clips
 ! note: using sound clips (samples of actual drums) is easy and gives good results.  Synthing drums is more work.
 ! http://blog.demofox.org/2015/03/14/diy-synth-basic-drum/
 * Demo = Drum

--16--
 * cymbal from static?
  * a 5th common wave form: "noise"
  * show how to use an envelope to make the noise meaningful
  * demo: play some drums and symbols
 * Demo = Drum, but use space bar.

--17--
 * Automatic volume adjustments
  * briefly explain compressors and limiters
  * useful for keeping things from clipping
  * also useful to make things "pop out" more. 
  * demo: drums with side chain
  * mention that we do this in heroes
  * mention battlefield's HDR audio system
  * we aren't doing automatic. we made an envelope to go with the deep drum to make it sound more powerful
 * demo: a button to toggle a melody.  a button to toggle ducking melody based on drum volume or not.
 * Demo = Ducking

--18--
 ? space bar = cymbal, other things = drum notes. press 1 to toggle an auto melody?
 ? also on audio samples
 * could show how the same notes over and over sound more interesting with an effect powered by LFO
 * Basic LPF and HPF
  * demo: how they sound
  * demo: use them in echo?
  * mention: biquads, IIR/FIR.
  * mention: subtractive synth: use filters to carve the block.  different wave forms have different frequencies at different amplitudes so sound differently when filtered.
 ? figure out biquads, or something similar?
  * can also talk about band pass and band stop filters

--19--
 * Positional sound
  * delay per ear more important than volume changes
  * demo: some 3d sound? does it make sense to do in a large room?  maybe not...
 ? probably won't work with the demo room

--20--
 * real time vs offline
  * how many ms to not feel a delay? was it 7ms?
  * better effects in offline processing, and can even look into future for cooler sounding effects (like a reverse echo)

-- 21--
 * closing slide
  * shadertoy -> lets you do audio
  * my blog -> more audio synth info there now and future content
  * where to get code from presentation -> https://github.com/Atrix256/MusicSynth
 * using audio synth for smooth terrain generation.
 * also dsp for other things.  low pass filter movement data to smooth it out.

-- stretch topics
 * mention 303 and 707 with a sound clip?
 * FFT / IFFT? do we care? maybe drop this
 * 8 bit music: I'm not an expert, but the sound isn't from being "8 bit".  low sample rate starts to sound like it, but more in faked chords by playing very short notes in a row?
 * arpegiators
 * automatic note timing fixing (to get timing more correct)
 * converting timing (like in 4/4, im on note 3, bar 5) to be a sample number
 * stereo sounds or higher.
  * effects different per ear.
  * ping pong echo between left and right ear.
 * wave file = header, and then just audio samples.
